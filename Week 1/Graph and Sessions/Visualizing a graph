To write out the graph, use a tf.summary.FileWriter. So, use tf.summary.FileWriter to write out the session graph.

But the graph that comes out as an output, isn't in the human readable form. It is rather in a binary format.
To get the graph in a better visualisation format, use Tensorflow Board.
  from google.datalab.ml import TensorBoard
  TensorBoard().start('./summaries')
  
  
  # I have come across a particular observation that the graph of the "training and validation accuracy" is the inverse of the graph of the
  "training and the validation loss".
  # on searching more I came across the fact that it is not so. It is in just the case of classification. There would be a concept of mAP as well.
